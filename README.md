## Requirements
* SilverStripe 3.1 (version master / 2.+ / 1.+)
* Silverstripe 3.0 (version [0.5](https://github.com/colymba/GridFieldBulkEditingTools/tree/0.5))

## Installation
### Composer
* `composer require "colymba/gridfield-bulk-editing-tools:*"`

### Manual
* Download and copy module in SilverStripe root directory

## 2.0.0 deprecations
Major depractions in latest 2.0.0 release:
* The `GridFieldBulkImageUpload` has been renamed to `GridFieldBulkUpload`.
* `onBulkImageUpload` callback has been renamed to `onBulkUpload`

## Bulk Upload
Upload multiple images or files at once into DataObjects. Perfect for galleries and the like.

    $config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkUpload());

See [BULK_UPLOAD.md](bulkUpload/BULK_UPLOAD.md) for detailed configuration.

## Bulk Manager
Perform actions on multiple records straight from the GridField

    $config->addComponent(new GridFieldBulkManager());

See [BULK_MANAGER.md](bulkManager/BULK_MANAGER.md) for detailed configuration.

## Interdependencies
The `GridFieldBulkUpload` component makes use of `GridFieldBulkManager` to allow quick editing of the newly uploaded files. Although not nescessary for the component to work, adding `GridFieldBulkManager` too to your `GridFieldConfig` will give you this advantage.

#### @TODO
* Add individual actions for each upload (update + cancel)
* Handle and display errors better for: creation, update, cancel
